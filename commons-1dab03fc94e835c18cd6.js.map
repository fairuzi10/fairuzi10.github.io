Most commonly\n\t   * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n\t   * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n\t   *\n\t   * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n\t   * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the components.\n\t   * It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For example we can\n\t   * add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n\t   *\n\t   * ```jsx\n\t   * import Transition from 'react-transition-group/Transition';\n\t   *\n\t   * const duration = 300;\n\t   *\n\t   * const defaultStyle = {\n\t   *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n\t   *   opacity: 0,\n\t   * }\n\t   *\n\t   * const transitionStyles = {\n\t   *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n\t   *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n\t   * };\n\t   *\n\t   * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n\t   *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n\t   *     {(state) => (\n\t   *       <div style={{\n\t   *         ...defaultStyle,\n\t   *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n\t   *       }}>\n\t   *         I'm A fade Transition!\n\t   *       </div>\n\t   *     )}\n\t   *   </Transition>\n\t   * );\n\t   * ```\n\t   *\n\t   * As noted the `Transition` component doesn't _do_ anything by itself to its child component.\n\t   * What it does do is track transition states over time so you can update the\n\t   * component (such as by adding styles or classes) when it changes states.\n\t   *\n\t   * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n\t   *  - `ENTERING`\n\t   *  - `ENTERED`\n\t   *  - `EXITING`\n\t   *  - `EXITED`\n\t   *\n\t   * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component begins the\n\t   * \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from its current transition state,\n\t   * to `'entering'` for the duration of the transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once\n\t   * it's complete. Let's take the following example:\n\t   *\n\t   * ```jsx\n\t   * state= { in: false };\n\t   *\n\t   * toggleEnterState = () => {\n\t   *   this.setState({ in: true });\n\t   * }\n\t   *\n\t   * render() {\n\t   *   return (\n\t   *     <div>\n\t   *       <Transition in={this.state.in} timeout={500} />\n\t   *       <button onClick={this.toggleEnterState}>Click to Enter</button>\n\t   *     </div>\n\t   *   );\n\t   * }\n\t   * ```\n\t   *\n\t   * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state and\n\t   * stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) when finally switches to `'entered'`.\n\t   *\n\t   * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n\t   */\n\t\n\t  var Transition = function

Most commonly\n   * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n   * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n   *\n   * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n   * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the components.\n   * It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For example we can\n   * add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n   *\n   * ```jsx\n   * import Transition from 'react-transition-group/Transition';\n   *\n   * const duration = 300;\n   *\n   * const defaultStyle = {\n   *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n   *   opacity: 0,\n   * }\n   *\n   * const transitionStyles = {\n   *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n   *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n   * };\n   *\n   * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n   *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n   *     {(state) => (\n   *       <div style={{\n   *         ...defaultStyle,\n   *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n   *       }}>\n   *         I'm A fade Transition!\n   *       </div>\n   *     )}\n   *   </Transition>\n   * );\n   * ```\n   *\n   * As noted the `Transition` component doesn't _do_ anything by itself to its child component.\n   * What it does do is track transition states over time so you can update the\n   * component (such as by adding styles or classes) when it changes states.\n   *\n   * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n   *  - `ENTERING`\n   *  - `ENTERED`\n   *  - `EXITING`\n   *  - `EXITED`\n   *\n   * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component begins the\n   * \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from its current transition state,\n   * to `'entering'` for the duration of the transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once\n   * it's complete. Let's take the following example:\n   *\n   * ```jsx\n   * state= { in: false };\n   *\n   * toggleEnterState = () => {\n   *   this.setState({ in: true });\n   * }\n   *\n   * render() {\n   *   return (\n   *     <div>\n   *       <Transition in={this.state.in} timeout={500} />\n   *       <button onClick={this.toggleEnterState}>Click to Enter</button>\n   *     </div>\n   *   );\n   * }\n   * ```\n   *\n   * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state and\n   * stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) when finally switches to `'entered'`.\n   *\n   * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n   */\n\n  var Transition = function (_React$Component) {\n    _inherits(Transition, _React$Component);\n\n    function Transition(props, context) {\n      _classCallCheck(this, Transition);\n\n      var _this = _possibleConstructorReturn(this, _React$Component.call(this, props, context));\n\n      var parentGroup = context.transitionGroup;\n      // In the context of a TransitionGroup all enters are really appears\n      var appear = parentGroup && !parentGroup.isMounting ?

This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.\n *\n *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks.
